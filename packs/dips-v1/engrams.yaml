  statement: GTD inbox processing must include an 8th option 'DONE' for tasks that have already been accomplished, in addition
    to the existing 7 options (ACTION, PROJECT, REFERENCE, RESEARCH, SOMEDAY, WAITING, DELETE).
  rationale: Without DONE, completed tasks are deleted (losing accomplishment records) or misclassified.
